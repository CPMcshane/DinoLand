# Overview

I created this program to be able to learn and practice with SQL and relational databases. As a software engineer I want to become as well-rounded

as possible. Even if my future work does not use relational databases, I wanted to develop a basic understanding of the SQL commands and how relational

databases work.

My program is designed to be able to take information from a .csv file and turn it into a relational database. The data contained characteristics of different dinosaurs.

The made-up problem I created to pracctice with was a dinosaur park needed to be able to safely separate their dinosarus into the different habitats the park had.

Carnivores, Herbivores, and flying dinosaurs all had to be kept separate from each other. Territorial-tempered dinosaurs could not be placed with any other territorial

dinosaurs. Passive-tempered dinosaurs can live in peace with any other dinosaurs, so they had to be spread out evenly among the habitats. There were two flying dinosaur

habitats, two carnivore habitats, and three herbivore habitats available at the park.

# Relational Database

The relational database I used was one that I created for the purpose of practicing with SQL. I created the table in

Excel, and converted it to a .csv file which I then converted into an relational database in the program. The data I 

used included dinosaur names, their diet, whether or not the dinosaur was territorial, and whether or not it was a flying dinosaur.

The table had a row for each dinosaur, and the characteristics were made into the columns

# Development Environment
I used visual studio code to write and test the program.

I used github for source control, and to make the code available for others to see

The program was made in python and used the sqlite3 module to be able to perform the SQL commands

# Future Work


* Clean up the code, organizing things into functions.
* Change the formatting of the habitat output at the end of the program to look better.
* Add an option to add more dinosaurs to the database and be able to find a habitat for the dino.
